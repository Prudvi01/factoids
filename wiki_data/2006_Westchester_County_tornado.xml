The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an F2 [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] 

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=[[2006-07-12]]| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] and tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. The waterspout tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. The tornado came ashore near the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). The tornado lifted two minutes later near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] and tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=[[2006-07-12]]| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (20.9&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=[[2006-07-12]]| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;[[yard]] (91&amp;nbsp;[[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;[[mile|miles]] (4.8&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]]) path across the river.

The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58&amp;nbsp;mph (93&amp;nbsp;km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado.

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled to $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD). 

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58&amp;nbsp;mph (93&amp;nbsp;km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157&amp;nbsp;mph (253&amp;nbsp;km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]] which traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD). 

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]] which traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity.

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006 which traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006 which traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed.

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33&amp;nbsp;minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a 58&amp;nbsp;mph (93&amp;nbsp;km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157&amp;nbsp;mph (253&amp;nbsp;km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05&amp;nbsp;p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC).

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 1:05&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (17:05&amp;nbsp;UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60&amp;nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (95&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines.&lt;ref name="Tstmwind"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625642 (Thunderstorm Wind)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625642}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3&amp;nbsp;miles (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''Westchester Tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled 13&amp;nbsp;miles (20.9&amp;nbsp;km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3&amp;nbsp;mi (4.8&amp;nbsp;km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm.

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.&lt;ref name="WESH"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-7-13|author=Associated Press| title=Tornado Rips Through Suburban New York| publisher=[[Internet Broadcasting|Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc.]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Lisa W.

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm.

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]].

The '''July 2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]].

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
On July&amp;nbsp;12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched little kids down on their penis's in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006. It traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter,&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

Authorities admitted they were embarrassed after originally believing the tornado had touched down in [[Newark]], [[New Jersey]] and leveled the entire city.  They later found out that all of New Jersey has the overall look and feel of a shithole, and quickly corrected their innocent mistake.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]].&lt;ref name="Tornado3"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #606978 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~606978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of {{convert|13|mi|km|abbr=on}} through two states over a period over 33 minutes.&lt;ref name="MSSum"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-7-14| title=Summary of Tornado| publisher=[[National Weather Service]] in Upton, New York| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/pns/torjul06.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.&lt;ref name="WESH"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-7-13|author=Associated Press| title=Tornado Rips Through Suburban New York| publisher=[[Internet Broadcasting|Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Lisa W.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''', caused by a massive [[fart]], was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.&lt;ref name="WESH"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-07-13|author=Associated Press| title=Tornado Rips Through Suburban New York| publisher=[[Internet Broadcasting|Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Lisa W.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads.

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]].&lt;ref name="Tornado3"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #606978 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~606978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of {{convert|13|mi|km|abbr=on}} through two states over a period over 33 minutes.&lt;ref name="MSSum"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-07-14| title=Summary of Tornado| publisher=[[National Weather Service]] in Upton, New York| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/okx/pns/torjul06.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.&lt;ref name="WESH"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-07-13|author=Associated Press| title=Tornado Rips Through Suburban New York| publisher=[[Internet Broadcasting|Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Lisa W.

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006&amp;nbsp;[[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD) in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9&amp;nbsp;million 2008 USD).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="WCBS"/&gt; At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300&amp;nbsp;yd (274&amp;nbsp;m) wide&lt;ref name="Tornado2"/&gt; and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County.&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news| author=Jim Fitzgerald| date=2006-07-14| title=Weather Service confirms F-2 tornado roared through N.Y., Conn. on Wednesday| work=[[USA Today]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2006-07-14-ny-tornado-confirmed_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York&amp;ndash;[[Connecticut]] border.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.&lt;ref name="WESH"&gt;{{cite web| date=2006-07-13|author=Associated Press| title=Tornado Rips Through Suburban New York| publisher=[[Internet Broadcasting|Internet Broadcasting Systems, Inc]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081122101734/http://www.wesh.com/news/9510358/detail.html| archivedate= 22 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news| author=Lisa W.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states.

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10&amp;nbsp;foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was an F2 tornado that traveled through Westchester County, NY. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950-2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt; It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC).

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July&amp;nbsp;12,&amp;nbsp;2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=2008-12-06|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

On July&amp;nbsp;12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=2006-07-12| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=2008-11-29|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=2006-07-13| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=2008-11-30|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]].

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=December 6, 2008|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=July 12, 2006| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=July 13, 2006| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #626587 (Tornado)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~626587}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.&lt;ref name="THPWest"/&gt;

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:37&amp;nbsp;UTC); two minutes later, a {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to {{convert|157|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, and struck the California Closet Warehouse.

==Impact==
[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1&amp;nbsp;million in damage.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt;

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; A 10-foot (3&amp;nbsp;m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.&lt;ref name="USAT"/&gt; Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed.

The '''2006 Westchester County tornado''' was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled {{convert|13|mi|km}} into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400&amp;nbsp;m) in diameter.&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:01&amp;nbsp;UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (20:03&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name="MSSum"/&gt; When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.&lt;ref name="THPWest"&gt;{{cite web| author=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| year=2007| title=Tornado History Project: Westchester, New York Tornadoes, 1950–2007| publisher=Joshua Lietz (TornadoHistoryProject.com)| accessdate=December 6, 2008|url=http://tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado.php?yr=%25&amp;mo=%25&amp;day=%25&amp;st=New+York&amp;fu=%25&amp;co=Westchester&amp;l=auto&amp;submit=Table&amp;ddat=on&amp;dsta=on&amp;dfuj=on&amp;dfat=on&amp;dinj=on&amp;dcou=on&amp;format=basic&amp;p=1&amp;s=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1&amp;nbsp;million.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45&amp;nbsp;pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;[[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]).&lt;ref name="Tornadowatch"&gt;{{cite web| author=Thompson| date=July 12, 2006| title=Severe Weather Watch #593 (Tornado Watch)| publisher=[[Storm Prediction Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2006/ww0593.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:00&amp;nbsp;UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (18:45&amp;nbsp;UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel.&lt;ref name="NJFunnel"&gt;{{cite web| author=Stuart Hinson| year=2006| title=July 12, Weather Event #625643 (Funnel Cloud)| publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]| accessdate=November 29, 2008| url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~625643}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name="Tornado1"/&gt; About 15&amp;nbsp;minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (21:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Associated Press| date=July 13, 2006| title=Westchester County Storm: Let The Clean-Up Begin| publisher=[[WCBS-TV]]| accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://wcbstv.com/topstories/Tornado.Tornado.Warning.2.236314.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&amp;nbsp;EDT (19:30&amp;nbsp;UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100&amp;nbsp;yard (91&amp;nbsp;m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=on}} path across the river.

The Westchester Tornado was an F2 tornado that touched down in Rockland New York 

On July 12, a supercell thunderstorm developed over eastern New Jersey in association with a surface low-pressure area in southwestern Ontario. Daytime heating in the Tri-State Region led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of showers and thunderstorms. With conditions favorable for the development of a tornado, the Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch was issued at 12:40 p.m. EDT (16:40 UTC). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 mph (95 km/h) in Warren County, which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a funnel cloud near Carlstadt at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into New York.

The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD; $10.8 million 2008 USD).

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. No one was killed by the tornado and there were only six minor injuries associated with it. Total damages from the tornado totaled to $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered.

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. No one was killed by the tornado and there were only six minor injuries associated with it. Total damages from the tornado totaled to $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. A interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground, the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 52 residences in Greenwich without power and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] declared a state of emergency for the town. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]].

Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 52 residences in Greenwich without power and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] declared a state of emergency for the town. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported via bus.

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. No one was killed by the tornado and there were only six minor injuries associated with it. Total damages from the tornado totaled to $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. A interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off.

The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut.

The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. A interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground, the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 52 residences in Greenwich without power and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] declared a state of emergency for the town. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported via bus.

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. No one was killed by the tornado and there were only six minor injuries associated with it. Total damages from the tornado totaled to $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappen Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. A interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground, the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 52 residences in Greenwich without power and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] declared a state of emergency for the town. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored.

The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. A interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground, the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 52 residences in Greenwich without power and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a state of emergency for the town. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus.

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and there only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Total damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado.

The Westchester Tornado was an unusual [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 [[mile|miles]] (20.9 [[kilometre|km]]) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC).

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and there only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Total damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] was issued at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 [[yard]] (91 [[metre|m]]) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 [[mile|miles]] (4.8 [[kilometre|km]]) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

The tornado first struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 [[foot (length)|foot]] (3 [[metre|m]]) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked twelve roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

[[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus.

The Westchester Tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]]. The tornado tracked for 13 miles (20.9 km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]]. It tracked 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river before moving back over land. Coming ashore, the tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county. The tornado continued through the county causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it lifted near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was completely shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and there only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Total damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD). 

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 miles (4.8 km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a clear path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees, and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported due to the tornado. In all, the tornado caused $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. Only one structure, a dock, and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. The tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby Comfort Inn had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. 200 emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The Westchester Tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on [[Tornadoes_of_2006#July_11-12|July 12, 2006]] which traveled 13 miles (20.9 km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33 minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures along the way until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left considerable damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD). 

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm became stronger and developed into a supercell thunderstorm as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 miles (4.8 km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC), two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified into an F2 tornado, packing winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At this time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, the tornado weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York/[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the tornado weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. The tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off of numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage, having two two-story concrete wall being destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed, injuring four of them. Concrete blocks from the building were thrown all over, several cars in the nearby parking lot were hit by the blocks. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school close to the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it a few times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving to the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] led officials to shut down a section of it near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]]. The tornado knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its life in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was also reported to several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. and caused $2 million (2006 USD) in damages.

As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut.

When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 miles (4.8 km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], the it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. 200 emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. 200 emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The Westchester Tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled 13 miles (20.9 km) into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 miles (4.8 km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling 3 mi (4.8 km) across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At around 1:05 p.m. EDT (17:05 UTC), a thunderstorm produced winds up to 60 [[miles per hour|mph]] (95 [[kilometres per hour|km/h]]) in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]], which snapped tree limbs and damaged power lines. A stronger thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) and produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a 3 miles (4.8 km) path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a 58 mph (93 km/h) wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to 157 mph (253 km/h), and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around 8 mi (12.8 km). After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling 2 mi (3.2 km) in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of 13 mi (20.9 km) through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's 2 mi (3.2 km) path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated. 

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The July 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (402 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The July 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated near the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a forested area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]].

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]] on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]].

Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a town-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]] was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, causing damage to numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

The tornado left significant damage in its wake. Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. Damages from the tornado totaled $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12, a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F2]] [[tornado]] that touched down in [[Rockland County, New York]], on July 12, 2006. It traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at F1 intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter, making it both the strongest and largest tornado in the county's history. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Rockland County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

Authorities admitted they were embarrassed after originally believing the tornado had touched down in [[Newark]], [[New Jersey]] and leveled the entire city. They later found out that all of New Jersey has the overall look and feel of a shithole, and quickly corrected their innocent mistake. 

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closest Warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:Radar image of westchester 2006 supercell.png|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] image of the supercell thunderstorm that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

[[de:Westchester-County-Tornado 2006]]
The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[Image:DCP 7760.JPG|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million (2006 USD).

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million (2006 USD).

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

[[de:Westchester-County-Tornado 2006]]
The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD).

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million (2006 [[United States Dollar|USD]]; $12.9 million 2008 USD) in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado.

The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to quickly respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita_scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was an F2 tornado that traveled through Westchester County, NY. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10 foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in the history of [[Westchester County, New York]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

[[File:2006 Westchester County tornado forrest damage.jpg|thumb|right|Tornado damage near a [[forest]]ed area]]
The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the [[California Closets]] warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed. The California Closet Warehouse suffered severe structural damage; two concrete walls were destroyed. An interior staircase, which employees used as a shelter, collapsed causing four injuries. Concrete blocks from the building were blown about, some of which struck cars in a nearby parking lot. A nearby [[Comfort Inn]] had part of its roof torn off. After a [[tornado warning]] was issued, a school near the warehouse was evacuated.

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a village-wide state of emergency. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison]] (conEdison) crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the Upper Harlem line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. During the time the rails were shut down, southbound passengers were transported by bus. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).

The 2006 Westchester County tornado was the strongest and largest [[tornado]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] since the [[1904 Chappaqua tornado]]. It touched down there on July 12, 2006 and traveled into southwestern [[Connecticut]] during a 33-minute span through two states. The tornado touched down at 3:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (19:30 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on the shore of the [[Hudson River]] before becoming a [[waterspout]] and traveling across the river. Coming ashore, the tornado entered [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] and struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]] at [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] intensity. After passing through the town, it intensified into an F2 tornado and grew to almost a quarter of a mile (400 m) in diameter. The tornado continued through the county, damaging numerous structures, until it crossed into Connecticut at 4:01 p.m. EDT (20:01 UTC). Not long after entering the state, it dissipated in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] at 4:03 p.m. EDT (20:03 UTC). When the tornado entered Westchester County, it was the eighth known tornado to either touch down or enter the county since 1950.

Two barns and a warehouse were destroyed, and a large stained-glass window was shattered. Numerous homes and businesses were damaged and thousands of trees were uprooted. There were no fatalities and only six minor injuries were associated with the storm. The cost of damages was estimated at $12.1 million.

[[File:July 12, 2006 Westchester Tornado.gif|thumb|left|[[Weather radar]] animation of the supercell that spawned the tornado at 3:45 pm EDT]]
On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]]. About 15 minutes later, a [[tornado warning]] was issued for southern Rockland and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] counties which would remain in effect until 4:15 p.m. EDT (21:15 UTC). At around 3:30 p.m. EDT (19:30 UTC), an [[Fujita scale#Parameters|F1]] tornado touched down near [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]] along the [[Hudson River]] in [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]]. The 100 yard (91 m) wide tornado touched down on a dock before becoming a [[waterspout]] as it took a path across the river. The tornado passed near the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] before crossing into [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]]. Upon entering Westchester, it was the eighth tornado ever recorded in the county.

The tornado hit the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]], around 3:37 p.m. EDT (19:37 UTC); two minutes later, a wind gust was reported along the periphery of the tornado. As the tornado neared [[New York State Route 9A]], it intensified to F2 status, generating winds up to , and struck the California Closet Warehouse. At the time, the tornado was estimated to be 300 yd (274 m) wide and was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Westchester County. Shortly after, it weakened back to F1 intensity. Minor damage was reported through the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]] as the tornado neared the New York–[[Connecticut]] border. The track length through Westchester County was measured at around . After crossing the state border into [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], it weakened further before lifting at 4:03 p.m  EDT (20:03 UTC) in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] after traveling in Connecticut. Another brief touchdown may have occurred shortly after near the [[Merritt Parkway]]. Overall, the tornado tracked across a total of through two states over a period over 33 minutes.

The tornado took a path through [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]], and [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield]] counties, downing or uprooting thousands of trees and damaging several structures, including significant structural damage to the California Closets warehouse. Six minor injuries were also reported. In all, the tornado inflicted $12.1 million in damage.

Minor damage was reported in Rockland County. One dock and one boat were damaged by the tornado. After crossing the [[Hudson River]], the tornado entered Westchester County, where the worst of the damage took place. It struck the town of [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|Sleepy Hollow]], damaging roofs and tearing the siding off numerous homes and businesses. A 10-foot (3 m) tall stained-glass window in the St. Teresa of Avila Church was shattered. Afterwards, the town of [[Pocantico Hills, New York|Pocantico Hills]] was struck as the tornado intensified to F2 intensity. Several trees were uprooted and two barns were destroyed.

On July 12 a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]] developed over eastern [[New Jersey]] in association with a [[Low pressure area|surface low-pressure area]] in southwestern [[Ontario]]. Daytime heating in the [[Tri-State Region]] led to moderate instability, a key factor in the development of [[Atmospheric convection|showers and thunderstorms]]. With conditions favorable for the development of a [[tornado]], the [[Storm Prediction Center]] issued a [[tornado watch]] at 12:40 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]] (16:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). A strong thunderstorm developed around 2:00 p.m. EDT (18:00 UTC) which produced a [[funnel cloud]] near [[Carlstadt, New Jersey|Carlstadt]] at around 2:45 p.m. EDT (18:45 UTC), although no damage was associated with the funnel. That same storm intensified and developed into a supercell as it crossed into [[New York (state)|New York]].

As the tornado crossed [[New York State Route 9A]], it picked up a state trooper car and flipped it several times before it fell to the ground; the officer inside suffered only minor injuries. Moving towards the east-northeast, the tornado struck the towns of [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]] and [[Hawthorne, New York|Hawthorne]], damaging numerous trees and causing minor structural damage. Damage along the [[Saw Mill River Parkway]] prompted officials to shut down a section of the highway near Mount Pleasant. Trees fell on streets and railroad tracks, halting [[Metro-North Railroad]] service and creating major traffic delays. After passing by the [[Kensico Reservoir]] in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], the tornado crossed into [[Connecticut]], where it knocked down numerous power lines, cutting power to about 10,000 residences in the county. In all, six people sustained minor injuries and damages amounted to $10.1 million.

The weakening tornado ended its duration in Fairfield County, Connecticut, in the town of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]. Thousands of trees were either uprooted or snapped along the tornado's path through the state. Minor damage was inflicted upon several structures. The tornado left 1,700 residences in Greenwich without power and blocked six roads. Most of the damage was concentrated to the northwestern corner of the town. Damages in the state totaled to $2 million.

In the wake of the tornado, the mayor of Sleepy Hollow declared a state of emergency for the entire village. Two hundred emergency personnel responded to the storm. [[Consolidated Edison|ConEdison]] crews were sent out to repair downed power lines and clear roads. By the next night, power was restored to all but 600 of the previous 10,000 residences without power in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]. Westchester County opened its Emergency Operations Center after the storm to respond to the event. Two days after the storm, many of the roads had been cleared and power was fully restored. A recreational path in [[Tarrytown, New York]], was not expected to be open for another two weeks due to numerous fallen trees. [[Metro-North Railroad]] suspended trains on the northern part of the Harlem Line until 5:00 p.m. EDT (21:00 UTC) for the removal of debris on the tracks. Southbound passengers took buses while the tracks were shut down. All trains were back on schedule by 7:00 p.m. EDT (23:00 UTC).
